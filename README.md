## What is Lodash?

Lodash is "a javascript utility library delivering consistency, modularity, performance & extras". 
What does that mean? Lodash is a group of functions, pre-written, to get your Javascript to be 
more consistent (always use the same) and more performant (it does the thing fast).

It changes : 
```
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = 0;

for (i = 0, i < arr.length, i++) {
sum += arr[i]}
```

into :

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = _.sum(arr);

```

(spoiler alert: it returns 6)

## Why would you use Lodash?

Lodash became the most depended on npm package, and if you'll take time to think about a npm package, why not go for #1? 

Lodash helps programmers write more concise and easier to maintain JavaScript code. Lodash contains tools to simplify 
programming with strings, numbers, arrays, functions and objects (everything you hated about Javascript before).


## How to actually use Lodash?

First of all, install Lodash: 

```
$ npm i -g npm
$ npm i --save lodash

```

Then learn all of the functions you can use with Lodash!
