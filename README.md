## What is Lodash?

Lodash is "a javascript utility library delivering consistency, modularity, performance & extras". 
What does that mean? Lodash is a group of functions, pre-written, to get your Javascript to be 
more consistent (always use the same) and more performant (it does the thing fast).

It changes : 
```
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = 0;

for (i = 0, i < arr.length, i++) {
sum += arr[i]}
```

into :

```
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = _.sum(arr);

```

(spoiler alert: it returns 6)
